        <div class="desc">Kenya has diverse wildlife and spectacular landscapes. The country occupies an area of 580,367 square kilometers,
          out of which approximately 44,359 square kilometers or 7.5 percent is wildlife conservation area.
          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more" id="kenya">The protected areas embrace various types of ecosystems namely: forests, wetlands, savannah, mountains, marine,
            arid and semi-arid. The protected areas comprise of 23 terrestrial National Parks, 28 terrestrial National Reserves,
            4 marine National Parks, 6 marine National Reserves and 4 national sanctuaries. Some of the wildlife that can

            cheetahs, hippos, crocodiles and more than 1070 species of birds. Together with safaris, the country’s other
            major tourist attractions are the coastal beaches. Kenya has 536 kilometers of unspoiled white-sand beaches lined
            with palm trees and coconut trees. At the coast, holidaymakers can see spectacular marine life while snorkeling,
            enjoy water sports such as kitesurfing, windsurfing, dhow sailing and kayaking. Mombasa, which is Kenya’s second
            largest city after Nairobi (the capital city) has a rich cultural and historical background dating as early as
            the 8th century. Malindi and Lamu are also popular destinations at the coast. Other Kenya’s tourism products
            are business travel, eco-tourism, conference tourism, cruse tourism, cultural tourism, mountain climbing/trekking,
            golfing, birding etc.</span>

        <div class="desc">Bora Bora, one of the Society Islands in French Polynesia, is the remains of an extinct, two-peaked volcano almost
          entirely encircled by a barrier reef. The lagoon created between the island and the reef -- Bora Bora’s major draw
          for tourists -- has warm, turquoise waters teeming with tropical marine life, and a number of tiny islets called
          motu completing the picture-postcard scene.
          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more" id="kenya"> Tourism is the number one industry in Bora Bora so there are plenty of activities and excursions for visitors to
            consider, but the setting is likely to inspire sedentary days spent soaking in the atmosphere of this true island
            paradise.The majority of activities and excursions for Bora Bora visitors are in or on the lagoon. These include
            snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, glass-bottom boat tours, sunset cruises and outrigger canoe trips. You can
            explore the lagoon independently with jet-ski, kayak and snorkel equipment, or take a guided trip with Moana
            Adventure Tours (moanatours.com) or Keawai Excursons (diveasyborabora.com) in search of rays and sharks. Scuba
            classes and excursions are available through the Bora Bora Diving Center (boradiving.com), Top Dive Polynesia
            (topdive.com) and Diveasy Bora Bora (diveasyborabora.com). Consult your hotel concierge for a recommendation.
            For an especially memorable experience, try a shark or manta ray feeding safari. On dry land, take a guided hike
            up Mount Pahia or Mount Otemanu or a driving tour of Bora Bora’s forest-lined interior roads. Matira Beach Park
            at the southern tip of the island is popular for its white sand and breezy trade winds. A bike ride around the
            island’s mostly flat, 20-mile coastal road will take about half a day, depending how many stops you make.</span>

          <span class="more">
            These islands are no more than six feet above sea level and lie 73 degrees East Equator. The islands are grouped into nineteen
            administrative ‘atolls’, and vary in size and character. Some are sandbanks, while others are tropical islands,
            with lush vegetation, ringed with coral reefs, turquoise lagoons full of marine life, and white sandy beaches.Specks
            of emerald green enveloped by dazzling turquoise waters like scattered beads in the ocean; white powdery beaches,
            tall palms lean on towards the sea, crystalline white sands giving way to crystal clear waters, shades of turquoise
            blend flawlessly with deeper hues of blue; pristine coral reefs and some of the most incredible underwater life
            on our planet.</span>

            Undeniably, the beaches are the big attraction, and what beaches: exquisite ribbons of pearlescent sand lapped by topaz waters
            and backed by lush hills and big glacis boulders. And hardly a soul in sight. Choosing your favourite beach is
            like trying to pick a flavour of ice cream – they're all so good! Hot favourites include world-famous Anse Source
            d'Argent, secluded Anse Marron, sexy Anse Takamaka and picture-postcard perfect Anse Lazio.Diving and snorkelling
            are the most popular activities in the Seychelles, and rightly so.White-sand beaches, secluded coves, coral-coloured
            sunsets, swish hotels, slick restaurants, hushed spas. With such a dreamlike setting, it's not surprising that
            honeymooners and those seeking a glamorous tropical getaway have long had the Seychelles at the top of their
            wish lists. Charge your camera batteries, people – the Seychelles is not dubbed 'The Galàpagos of the Indian
            Ocean' for nothing. Watching sea turtles nesting on Bird Island's sandy beaches or giant Aldabra tortoises roaming
            freely on Curieuse is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences. If you're hoping to spot sooty terns, tropicbirds,
            warblers and magpie robins in their natural habitats, the bird sanctuaries of Aride, Cousin, and Bird Islands
            should figure heavily in your planning. And Praslin's Vallée de Mai is a slice of Eden where you can see the
            very rare coco de mer palms in their natural state.</span>
